Stock Statistic Chart  

A small Python web app that displays closing prices of a stock over time and lets  
you overlay basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) on top of the  
chart.  

Usage / Examples  

When you start the app, the chart will:  
- Default to the last 30 days starting from today of closing price data for  
  the first available stock.  
- Show the x-axis as days and the y-axis as closing price ($).  

You can:  
- Change the stock ticker.  
- Adjust the date range.  
- Overlay statistics (mean, median, std deviation).  

Purpose  

This chart is meant to make stock data easier to interpret.  
- Mean and median lines highlight typical price levels.  
- Standard deviation lines show how much the price has moved around those  
  averages.  

Itâ€™s not a trading system, and only meant for educational purposes.
